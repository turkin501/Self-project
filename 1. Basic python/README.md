<b> Problem statement <b/>
  
1. Adding 2 large numbers:

Build a program that we can find the sum of 2 large number (2 numbers are in string format. ). .  Do not use any function to convert from string to int. Do school mathematics, compute sum of digits from right to left and remember to keep the carry for next step.

For example, input:

343.34+34.533

output: 377.873
